## About This Repository

This repository is a clone of my general django project setup code: [Original Repository](https://github.com/josuehernandezz/general_django_project.git). I have created this new repository to:

- **Customize the code** for my specific use case.
- **Track personal changes**.
- **Use the existing code as a foundation** for a new project.

This project does **not** directly edit the original repository. Any changes made here are independent and do not affect the original codebase.
